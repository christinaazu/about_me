  <p><em>Welcome</em> to my page and thanks for stopping by! Here you will learn a little more about me, my brand, and current projects.</p>

<p>Showing horses has been a constant in my life since I was 8 years old. Making my way from 4-H up to the Quarter Horse Circuit, I've spent the last 18 years devoted to the equestrian lifestyle. The sophistication of english riding and the vintage feel of western disciplines sparked my passion for design, and my experiences as both an NFL cheerleader and Miss Washington USA gave me a true feel for style. From apparel to magazine advertisements, my idea of beautiful is defined with simple, clean, and timeless looks that are undeniably flattering.
